HOW IT WORKS

Put a video in the folder with the script, and name that video "video"

Run the "Start" file

The console will show its % for processing the video frames

After frames are processed, the playback starts

If you want it recorded, you need to record it yourself, it does not save the playback as a video

MAKE SURE TO PRESS "F11" WHEN THE CONSOLE OPENS, THIS WORKS IN FULL SCREEN
